However, the patient's blood pressure is already fairly high, and Diltiazem might not be the best first line therapy. Beta-blockers would typically be considered first, unless contraindicated.

It can provide detailed images of the brain and help identify any potential injuries or abnormalities that could explain the patient's symptoms.

['A 10-year-old girl is brought to the physician because of a severe, throbbing headache for 1 hour. The headache is located in the right frontotemporal region. It is her fifth such headache in the past 2 months. Her mother says that all the previous episodes started after soccer practice, following which the child would lock herself in her room, close the curtains, and sleep for a few hours. After waking up, the headache is either diminished or has stopped entirely. One month ago, the child was diagnosed with myopic vision and has been wearing glasses since. Her 4-year-old brother had herpetic gingivostomatitis 2 months ago. Her vital signs are within normal limits. Funduscopic examination is inconclusive because the child is uncooperative. The remainder of the examination shows no abnormalities. MRI of brain is required. ']

This is a common condition in children and adolescents. While an MRI can be helpful in certain situations, such as when neurological signs and symptoms are present, it is generally not required for diagnosing migraines, especially when the symptoms are typical and there is no other concerning symptom or sign. The child's recent diagnosis of myopic vision and her brother's history of herpetic gingivostomatitis are likely unrelated to her headaches. Before resorting to an MRI, it would be more appropriate to try conservative management steps such as ensuring adequate hydration, rest, avoiding triggering factors and possibly using over-the-counter pain relievers. If these measures fail, or if the headaches increase in frequency or severity, further investigation may be warranted. However, based on the information provided, an immediate MRI does not seem necessary.",No,"Consider the following clinical note:

This causes distant objects to be blurry while close objects appear normal. The symptoms described in the note do not directly correlate with myopic vision. The note mentions severe, throbbing headaches that occur after physical activity and are alleviated by rest and sleep. These symptoms are more indicative of migraines or exertion headaches. The note does not report any vision-related issues that could be attributed to myopia, such as difficulty seeing distant objects, squinting, eyestrain, or headaches due to eyestrain.
